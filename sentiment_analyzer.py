        - **Vocabulary Size**: 2000 features
        - **N-grams**: 1-2 (single words and word pairs)
        
        ### üìä Text Preprocessing Steps
        1. **Lowercase conversion**: Normalize text case
        2. **HTML tag removal**: Clean web-scraped content
        3. **Special character removal**: Focus on words only
        4. **Stopword removal**: Remove common words like 'the', 'is', 'and'
        5. **Lemmatization**: Convert words to base form (e.g., 'running' ‚Üí 'run')
        
        ### üéØ Model Performance
        - **Training Data**: 40 sample movie reviews

        ### üöÄ Future Enhancements
        - Expand to larger IMDB dataset (50,000+ reviews)
        - Implement deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
        - Add aspect-based sentiment analysis
        - Include neutral sentiment classification
